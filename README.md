# Dropbox-Restaurants
Alongside five other students in the 2023-2024 cohort of MIT's Break Through Tech program, I used data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings) to develop a recommendation system that uses users' past ratings of restaurants to suggest restaurants they haven't yet visited.

### Files
